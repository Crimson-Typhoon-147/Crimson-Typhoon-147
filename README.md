# 💫 About Me

Hi, I’m **Soumyashree Sahoo** 👋  
I’m a **cybersecurity-focused Computer Science undergraduate** with a strong interest in **penetration testing, web application security, and applied cryptography**. I work on hands-on security projects that focus on real-world threat models rather than theoretical implementations.

Recently, I’ve been building projects like **EntropyLane**, a secure messaging prototype powered by physical-world entropy, and **ProofVault**, a system designed to ensure tamper-evident digital evidence verification. Alongside project work, I actively practice through **CTFs, security labs, and vulnerability analysis**, strengthening my understanding of how modern attacks and defenses operate.

I’m particularly interested in **VAPT and security analyst roles**, where I can apply structured problem-solving, tooling knowledge, and continuous learning to real systems. I value clear documentation, reproducible workflows, and building proof-of-work that demonstrates practical security skills.
